# Kickfame
Kickfame is a website where indie filmmakers can upload their movies, tv-series etc. They have to set a goal on how many likes they would like to get. So, instead of money they'll get more reputation. Something that's still missing on today's internet I think. 

Kickfame is a work in progress, but it doesn't have any deadline. It's a project I'm planning to slowly finish over time. It's also very ambitious since I would like to write all kinds of scripts and make it look beautiful. Currently I only have the bare HTML and CSS which doesn't yet look amazing. The next stage is going to be adding javascript to the site to make it more interactive. After that I'm going to start with PHP and MySQL databases so people can create their accounts and can actually upload stuff. Like I said, very ambitious since I'm still (as of the time I'm writing this) fifteen years old.
